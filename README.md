### My Homelab
My self-hosted server running Kubernetes with GitOps approach.

## Introduction

This repository contains all the configuration files that is also the reference for the cluster's GitOps system.

In my day job, I have been working with Kubernetes clusters hosted in Azure for a long time, but I still donâ€™t have a full understanding of all the microcomponents and intricacies of a Kubernetes cluster. So, after a ton of research I decided to convert my old laptop into a Ubuntu Server that can host a Kubernetes.

This cluster serves as my playground where I can experiment, break things, fix things, and especially build solutions that could potentially benefit me.

## Hardware & Tools

The machine that I am using is an old Dell Latitude 7290 with the following Specifications.
